One of my duties as lecturer is supervising final year projects. Seeing students engage with a piece of mathematics on their own is an interesting and rewarding experience. As part of the process of guiding and advising, of observing students and with the benefit of hindsight one distills little nuggets of advice. Advice that, one hopes, might help students engage deeper with the mathematics and benefit more from the process.

The document below contains some of these nuggets, written in a form that may be useful to students writing a bachelor thesis or final year project in mathematics or some other technical subject. I am grateful to my colleagues who read it and helped improve it and to my students who provided me with the necessary experience to write it.
