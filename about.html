	My name is Martins Bruveris and I am doing machine learning at Onfido. I started out in
	mathematics, did research in infinite-dimensional Riemannian geometry at taught as
	lecturer at Brunel University London. In autumn 2018 I decided that it is time for a
	career change and moved into machine learning. It has been an exciting journey so far.
